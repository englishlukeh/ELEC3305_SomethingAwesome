# ELEC3305_SomethingAwesome
A  Python-Tkinter based audio editing/manipulation software program

## Introduction
I will design a functional GUI-based software program for audio manipulation and editing using Tkinter and Python. I will demonstrate the the skills of **problem solving**, **visual design**, **debugging**, **testing** and **signal analyses**.

Credit Level:
* Functional, compiled software program built in Python and Tkinter
* Able to import and manipulate audio in wave format
* Selectable high-pass, low-pass, bandpass, bandpass combination filters
* Acoustic response simulation (i.e. playing audio in a concert hall, etc.)
* Adjustable equalizer
* Visualizer for audio

Additional Factors:
* Good user interface
* Isolation of specific instruments, vocals
* Ability to import other formats of audio (mp3, flac, etc.)
* Dynamic Equalizer (see below)
* Slow down and speed up audio
* Pitch shift up and down audio

## Dynamic Equalizer
Firstly I will design a dynamic equalizer that adjusts the equalization of the audio that automatically adjusts to what is playing.

Secondly I will design an equalization system that uses the microphone on the device that is connected to the speakers to dynamically equalize the playing in response to the room's response.
